Geno Analysis website Bioinformatics Tool 
Geno Analysis website Bioinformatics Tool 
Each user can build his own biological database(Insert Record -Update record - delete record) 
User can view the database and download the the sequence from database  as *csv file* to give him the ability to use  it in another genome analysis 
 User can do some Biological processes on genome which entered 
1-Transcription(Convert Deoxyribonucleic acid *DNA* to Ribonucleic acid *RNA*)
2-Translation(convert Ribonucleic acid (RNA)  sequence to  protein )
3-Stop codon Detection (detect stop coden in sequence)
4-most frequent k mer (get the most frequent part in dna using k mer which user choose)
5-GC content ( calculate the percentage of Guanine (G)  nucleotide bases in sequence and cytosine (C) 
6-reverse complement (get the reverse complement of sequence  )
